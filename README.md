# Simple-Bank-Project
 My first FINISHED program!! A simple program that can manage accounts to store an account balance.

Please note this is not on any server so any data will not be stored. This was more of a 'thing' I just made out of boredom.

# To download
Click on the green download button

Click to download as .ZIP folder

Double-click the setup.exe

Accept everything and download it

Go to the windows search bar, type 'Bank'

The wierd looking icon is the app

# To uninstall
Search in the search bar 'Control Panel'

Run Control Panel

Bottom click the fine text that says 'Unistall a Program'

Find program called 'Bank'

Right-click and select unistall

Accept everything and it will all be deleted (Unless you kept the .ZIP folder from downloading)

# THIS IS NOT AN OFFICAL APP TO ANY BANK! THIS IS ALSO NOT ANY SOFTWARE TO USE WHEN RUNNING A BANK!
# THIS WAS MADE OUT OF PURE FUN AND NOT MEANT FOR COMMERICAL USE!!!!!!!!!!!
